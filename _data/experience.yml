- company: Itsfound, Sydney
  position: Senior Developer
  duration: April, 2019 &mdash; Present
  summary: During 2019 I have been working for Itsfound in Sydney
    helping them extend the functionality of the Elixir/Phoenix
    application. Considering the growing complexity we shifted the
    application to an Umbrella, and have been working extracting and
    refactoring the codebase to into smaller more manageable otp
    applications. The front end also has a number of complex Vue JS
    components..<ul class="resume-item-list"><li><a href="https://www.itsfound.com.au">Itsfound</a></li></ul>

# Senior developer
- company: Netflakes / Bay4
  position: Senior Developer
  duration: Jan 2018, &mdash; Feb 2019
  summary: During 2018 I was contracted out to build an online learning
    solution in the health sector. Having previously being using
    Elixir on a number of different smaller projects gave me the
    confidence to use it on this LMS project. The backend made use
    of GraphQL for the API and also some channels for instance
    updates to the front end. The front end is a mix of standard
    Phoenix templates and plain vanilla javascript mixed in as well
    as React. The course builder and runner tools are quite complex
    and React was used for the entire UI including React router. My
    role in regards to the front end was to prove the concepts could
    work using React before handing the front end over to other
    remote developers. I love the productivity of the Elixir &
    Phoenix stack and in particular the functional paradigm. It
    enables the breakdown of components into fine grained pieces
    that are re-usable in ways that are far more difficult to
    achieve in an OO environment. I am a polyglot programmer who
    loves learning new programming-languages. I have worked with
    C#/.NET for four years. I have kept my Java skills up-to-date
    with the exposure to Amazon Lambda and have thoroughly enjoyed
    adding, Ruby & Elixir to my skill set. Whilst I am predominantly
    a back-end programmer, I have done a fair amount of work in the
    front-end of the most recent project and this is all in React. I
    have been surprised how elegant and easy it was to pick up
    React.<ul class="resume-item-list"><li><a href="https://courses.nvc-lms.com/login">NVC - Nambucca Valley Care - Learning</a></li></ul>

# Senior Developer
- company: Scout Recruitment, Brisbane
  position: Senior Developer, Team Lead
  duration: Jun, 2015  &mdash; Nov, 2017
  summary: For these two years I worked in the recruitment industry
    building a green-field talent management system in Ruby and
    Rails. I was the tech-lead for s small team of 3 developers
    and two test and support staff. I enjoyed being responsible
    for code review and using my keenness for teaching good code
    and design practices. My passion for TDD has seen me
    completely overhaul their testing processes and write a
    suite of integration and functional tests. The application
    also uses Information Retrieval to scan, tokenise and index
    all resume content and deploy as a REST API on AWS to the
    rest of the application. This enabled us to make the data
    available to a broader suite of existing recruitment
    applications. Some of the micro services in the back end
    were developed using Elixir and OTP and integrated with
    Rails via rest services.<br > We also needed to offload a lot of document conversion and
    report rendering to external services. Due to the lack of
    support for converting Microsoft document formats in Ruby,
    we decided to use Aspose/Java and to integrate this well
    with the current environment we moved all of this processing
    off to AWS/Lambda i.e. document conversion to PDF, Scanning
    all documents into page by page PNG images for preview &
    large report processing. AWS/Lambda is charged by the
    compute operation and this worked really well with our
    current pricing model. Scout uploads documents & report
    meta-data to AWS/S3. S3 triggers the AWS/Lambda task â€“ and
    finally once this is all completed an HTTP/post style
    request is made back to Scout to make the application aware
    of where it can collect the data.<ul class="resume-item-list"><li><a href="https://scouttalenthq.com/">Scout Talent/Recruitment</a></li></ul>

# Senior Developer
- company: Netflakes, CHC Pharmacy
  position: Developer,
  duration: Jun, 2014  &mdash; Jul, 2015
  summary: The application architecture is micro service based, with a
    main Rails framework based main application sitting in front
    of five Rest based services that handle the bulk of the
    business logic and data storage. Each service has it's own
    unit test and functional test suite. The main app again has
    its own unit and functional test suite that mocks out all
    the service interaction. All the business logic has been
    split out from the underlying framework and is tested
    without the requirement to load the framework, which means
    the unit test suites run in the order of seconds rather than
    minutes.< br />Having a tight feedback loop really facilitates the
    development process and the investment has paid off. We open
    sourced the multi-tenancy framework on github to give
    something back, which was a great experience.

# Senior Developer
- company: Janison, Coffs Harbour
  position: Developer, IT Manager
  duration: Jun, 2007  &mdash; Jul, 2014
  summary: Janison was a small 6 people startup in the .NET and online
    learning space here in Coffs Harbour when I first joined.
    All my previous work had been in the Java world and this was
    my first forray into the .NET world. I worked as a developer
    and later senior developer at Janison for four years before
    joining management and looking after the team of technicians
    who managed their hosted services and local networks and
    servers.<br />My previous home based networking skill in the FreeBSD world
    were very helpful and formed a solid basis for all the
    networking skills needed to run and develop Janison's hosted
    operations. My role also included the transition to self
    managed colocated server rack setups and finally the
    transitioning of the hosted operations to Microsoft Azure.
    Janison runs several Australia wide school assessment exams
    that have upwards of 25,000 simultaneous sessions. This
    provided a serious challenge to the hosted operations that
    was finally best suited to the Azure cloud.<ul class="resume-item-list"><li><a href="https://www.janison.com/">Janison</a></li></ul>
